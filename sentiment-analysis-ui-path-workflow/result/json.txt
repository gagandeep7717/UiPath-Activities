I'm good with that .. no named/criteria queries...all lucene.  The real kicker is that I cannot seem to get by the chicken/egg situation on re-indexing.  MassIndexer fails in an OGM environment because StatelessSession is not implemented and a direct iteration of objects using fulltext.index(entity) fails due to transaction issues (also seen in MassIndex). To compound the problem, HS/lucene must be used to implement the \"getAll\" query for mass indexing since criteria/named are not available. Seems wrong to rely on a technique that requires using the target index as the source for modifications.

As I mentioned, this service is supposed to offered to other business areas and projects where ideally we don't want them to have knowledge of how to tune a query on our end, so encapsulating hinting inside views which is modelled by us in the designer is desirable.\r\n\r\nThe multi-hint comment container sounds like the ideal solution, and exactly what we want, although I appreciate this is one of the more difficult approaches.\r\n\r\nAs for the exposing procedures, this also could be something we would fine very useful. In particular, although I think that may be for a seperate issue, the ability to use Oracle sys ref cursors which are outputted (by an OUT parameter) as some kind of source model in EDS. Having to define a static model for the output would be acceptable here.\r\n\r\nA Teiid implementation of ALL_ROWS/LEADING, although it would solve our problem in the short term, would not be preferable to the previous option as we would have to engage with you guys the next time their was a requirement for a particular hint and incur the inevitable lag between that and productisation.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the short term, any advice on how we could extend the Oracle translator to push this particular hint through would be appreciated. I have looked at the Oracle translator and written other translators, so a hint (no pun intended) could be enough. I reached the conclusion that the engine doesn't push comment style hints down to translators at all (please correct if I'm mistaken) and my best idea was to implement a dummy pushdown function which was translated to 1 (the number) using a function modifier, and then use its presence and parameters to inject the right Oracle hint (eg WHERE ... OR CUSTOMHINT('x','y')=1 sort of like the SDO_RELATE functions do. I'm sure there's a better way to do this, though.\r\n\r\nI think the final option of optimisation profiles could work too, although I agree this could be brittle and as mentioned being able to define hints on views/models themselves would be the ideal.\r\n\r\nGiven that there's multiple acceptable options you've given on how we can achieve what we want, I think it's best for you to choose what you believe which will be the most suitable, clean, and best for EDS with your familiarity of the engine rather than us choosing one approach.\r\n\r\nThanks."},{"id":129,"name":"Jeff Yemin","id1":2282,"author_id":129,"last_comment":"There is a decoder in 2.8.0 of the Java driver called com.mongodb.LazyDBDecoder that just saves the BSON for the document in a byte array wrapped by org.bson.LazyBSONObject, for on demand decoding.

This log grows over time, and space has to be freed in order to let the server keep running.\r\nASE is able to free space up to the oldest opened transaction; that is, if you keep a transaction open for too long, the transaction log only grows - until the allocated space is full and the database goes down.\r\nSo when using the Master-Slave feature of ActiveMQ with a database lock on table ACTIVEMQ_LOCK as synchronization monitor (see http://activemq.apache.org/jdbc-master-slave.html), you have to be careful. If you use only one dataSource, hence only one database, then the lock mechanism shall keep a transaction indefinitely open, and while messages are persisted the transaction log shall grow until you run out of space.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore strongly advised to use a dedicated database for this lock: just define another dataSource targetting a minimal database holding no data (only the ACTIVEMQ_LOCK table) and use it as a lockDataSource in your configuration.\r\nExample:\r\n{code}\r\n        <persistenceAdapter>\r\n            <jdbcPersistenceAdapter dataSource=\"#sybase-ds\" lockDataSource=\"#another-sybase-ds\"/>\r\n        </persistenceAdapter>\r\n{code}\r\n{quote}\r\n"},{"id":145,"name":"Christian Bauer","id1":2444360,"author_id":145,"last_comment":"https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-7984"},{"id":146,"name":"Guillaume Smet","id1":1905952,"author_id":146,"last_comment":"bq.

That said, I still think there's something weird going on in the JDBC adapter.\r\n\r\nbq. Do you confirm that the SequenceGenerator is exactly the same for Oracle ? If I understand, its goal is just to follow Rails conventions when naming sequences. We could rename it \"RailsSequenceGenerator\" and use it in both Oracle and Postgre dialects.\r\n\r\nNo. The principle is the same but the naming conventions are different. One of my problem was that Oracle and PostgreSQL don't have the same convention for sequence naming so the @SequenceGenerator with a named sequence wasn't acceptable.\r\n\r\nThe OracleSequenceGenerator should output: TABLENAME_SEQ as it's currently defined in your @SequenceGenerator.

So displaytag *would work* without any SLF4J deps, correct?\r\n\r\nI am not disagreeing with your choice of using SLF4J, I am disagreeing with your choice to force it and specific versions on client code when they do not need to be! :-)  This forces users to unnecessarily add exclusions to fix the SFL4J binding error, eliminate unnecesary deps (most notably in web-inf/lib such as different versions or the log4j one), and have potential SLF4J dep version problems.\r\n\r\nAs a best practice, it is up to the user of the framework to choose those things (e.g. use jcl over slf4j or not) that are not directly used.\r\n\r\nSo I think I understand that, since JCL is \"...old, not performant as SFL4J...\", you've decided to \"convert\" in a very easy way to SLF4J by adding slf4j-api and jcl104-over-slf4j.  That definitely works, but I think that should be my choice when the product uses JCL directly.\r\n\r\nWhile my sfl4j over jcl version is 1.5.10 and need to exclude displaytag's ones, it would be a nice correction to fix the log4j binding, either removing it or changing to test.
